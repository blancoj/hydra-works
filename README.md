# Hydra::Works

Hydra::Works is a flexible, extensible domain model that is intended to underlie a wide array of repository and  DAMS applications.  The primary objective of this model is to establish a framework that developers of tools (e.g., Sufia, Curate, Worthwhile, Avalon) can use for working with models in a general way, allowing adopters to easily use custom models with any tool.  Given this focus on interoperability, the initial work has been limited to structural metadata and access control, since these are the key actionable metadata.
