## What is this?

This is a project to establish a standard base data model for Hydra projects.

It is currently in _MAJOR_ flux and should not be used for code you care about.

It currently works for ActiveFedora 7, but will be migrated to ActiveFedora 8.

## Roadmap
* Collect use cases
* Architecture discussion
