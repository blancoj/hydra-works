At present Hydra::Works is soliciting use cases.

## Use Cases

A Use Case is comprised of:

* Sponsor(s) - The Github User ID (or User IDs) of the person advocating for this use case.
* Goal & Reason - Of the form "As a `<type of user>`, I want `<some goal>` so that `<some reason>`."
* Notes - Any supporting information, the basic course of action an actor would take.

You can submit a use case by one of the following methods:

* Creating an issue in Github
* Submitting a pull request that adds one or more use cases to the `./use-cases` directory

When merging a Use Case, make sure that each use case has a clear: Sponsor, Goal & Reason, and Notes.
If it meets those criteria, you are free to merge.

**NOTE: A merged use case does not mean it has been accepted. Only that the format is accepted. We will be synthesizing the use case at a later stage.**
